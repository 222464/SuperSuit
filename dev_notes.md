1. Make frame_stack work for discrete observations


* supersuit needs a requirements.txt, and for requirements to be in setup.py
* Additionally, supersuit should be hooked up into travis (add me as a maintainer and add the little box to the readme)
* Also, add me as a maintainer on PyPI right, please finally release it on PyPI, make sure it works, and add me as a maintainer
* Also, the documentation shouldn't mention the tests
* also, pettingzoo (in an unannounced and incomplete state) will be going out on PyPI pretty soon, allowing us to release supersuit on PyPI as well
